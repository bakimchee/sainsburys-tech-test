## Sainsburyâ€™s Tech Front End Exercise - Brief

In this exercise you will develop a product listing page and shopping basket. Your solution should:

- Be a website, using React
- Consume a JSON feed of products (see below) and display them on a page
- Allow users to add a product to their basket
- Allow users to view the products in their basket

## Stretch goals

With more time I would have like have added some more testing in the form of Cypress for e2e testing, I would have also like to improved test coverage. I would have also have liked to be able to add more time to the CI/CD process to make it more robust.

Additionally, adding animation to the sidebar by using something such as 'react-spring' would have been a good addition.
